# Here I would like to have almost the same list of checks as we have for add employee modal:
# - Check modal content
# - Close button should close the modal, no updates for employee
# - Cancel button should close the modal, no updates for employee
# - Click outside the modal should close the modal, no updates for employee
# - Click add should close the modal, employee is updated
# - Fields validations tests
# etc... I will skip these tests in this challenge due of lack of time
